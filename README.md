## Santander Bootcamp by Digital Inovation One 

In the Santander Bootcamp i was challenged to create an task App using Room persistency library. So i created the my kotlin task app from scratch, which i'm still working on improvements

In this project i have used:

- Room
- LiveData
- Navigation Component
- View Binding
- Fragments
- viewModel
- Recycler View
